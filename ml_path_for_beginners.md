# Step into the world of Machine Learning :fire:

Following is a very simple learning path designed for students to start with Machine learning. 


## Step 1 : Decide whether Machine Learning is your cup of tea ! 

Analyze the following !

- [ ] What is Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)?
- [ ] Impact and applications of AI/ML across various industries like Healthcare, Finance, Agriculture etc., and how it's improving human lives.
- [ ] Skills required for AI/ML

> Note : Don't let the AI craze which is happening around us let you start with Machine Learning. If you are really convinced about it's impact and if you feel it's your cup of tea, then go for it. Spend good time in analyzing these. If Yes, move to the next step


## Step 2 : Learn and Practise Python

- [ ] [Why Python for Machine Learning?](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-reasons-why-python-is-good-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-4a23f6bed2e6)
- [ ] Set up a local [environment](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- [ ] Experiment in [jupyter notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eCHD6f_phE&feature=push-u-sub&attr_tag=8UUQYNPGPspzbSqD-6)
- [ ] Build a simple project in python like atori games
- [ ] IDE : [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [VisualStudio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

> Tip : Try Jupyter notebook [extensions](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231) which is totally cool.

## Step 3 : Refresh Essential High School Mathematics

### Essential areas in Mathematics
 
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] Probability Theory
- [ ] Linear Algebra
- [ ] Calculus

>Tip : Instead of going by the subjects, go by the topics which is more essential for machine learning

### Statistics

- [ ] Read [Comprehensive Guide](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/comprehensive-practical-guide-inferential-statistics-data-science/)
- [ ] Watch [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTGEMoaWDCQ&index=18&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566)

### Probability Theory

- [ ] Read [Comprehensive Guide](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/02/basic-probability-data-science-with-examples/)
- [ ] Read [Basic Distributions](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/6-probability-distributions-data-science/)
- [ ] Watch [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTGEMoaWDCQ&index=18&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566)

### Linear Algebra

- [ ] [Comprehensive Guide](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/05/comprehensive-guide-to-linear-algebra/)
- [ ] Watch [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
- [ ] Watch [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

### Calculus

- [ ] [Comprehensive Guide](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/calculus.html)
- [ ] Watch [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
- [ ] Watch [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)


> Tip : It's okay to skip this step and learn the required math concepts where ever you encounter it. But I highly encourage you to go through the basics atleast (Comprehensive Guides and Khan Academy videos in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTGEMoaWDCQ&index=18&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566)) since it will make you feel comfortable when you go through the machine learning algorithms.


## Step 4 : Structured Online Courses - MOOC

- [ ] [Coursera AndrewNg Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

- [ ] Learn the algorithms which are not covered in MOOC
    - [ ] Naive Bayes
    - [ ] Tree based algorithms
    - [ ] Decision trees
      - [ ] Bagging algorithms like RandomForest
      - [ ] Boosting algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, etc.,
    - [ ] KNN etc.,

> Tip 1 : Do the assignments in python not in matlab or octave
>   - [ ] [Python Implementation of Assignments 1](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments)
>   - [ ] [Python Implementation of Assignments 2](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/Coursera-Machine-Learning)
>   - [ ] [Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with explanation](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-implementation-of-andrew-ngs-machine-learning-course-part-1-6b8dd1c73d80)

> Tip 2 : Whenever you learn an algorithm, make sure you do the following things.
>  - [ ] 1. Understand the basic intuition of how it works (without math)
>  - [ ] 2. Understand the underlying mathematics (Intuition you have now will give enough confidence to crack the math)
>  - [ ] 3. Implement the algorithm from scratch in python (Atleast for very important concepts like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, Neural Networks etc.,)
>  - [ ] 4. Solve a simple real world problem by downloading a relevant dataset. You can use Machine Learning libraries in this phase

> Tip 3 : Document and Maintain your code in a github 


### Step 4a : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
